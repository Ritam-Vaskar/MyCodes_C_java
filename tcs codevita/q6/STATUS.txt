Q6: LED Display Equation Problem - Analysis
=================================================

STATUS: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

The provided q6.c code is a skeleton with missing core functionality.

What the code attempts to do:
1. Parse 3-line LED display to extract equation (digits 0-9, operators +-*/,  brackets [])
2. Evaluate equation with custom operator precedence (given as 4-character string)
3. Generate variations by toggling exactly 1 LED segment
4. Sum values of all valid equations

ISSUES FOUND:
=============

1. PARSING ISSUES:
   - LED patterns in the code don't match actual input
   - Pattern matching failing for many characters
   - Debug shows: Expected equation but got "103" from testcase1.txt
   
2. MISSING IMPLEMENTATION:
   - evaluate() function returns hardcoded -1/0
   - No expression parser with custom precedence
   - No infix evaluation logic
   - No bracket handling
   
3. INCOMPLETE LOGIC:
   - generate_equations() doesn't properly enumerate variations
   - count_diff() exists but LED toggling logic not complete
   - No validation of generated equations

CURRENT TEST RESULTS:
=====================

testcase1.txt:
- Input: 11 characters in LED format
- Precedence: +-*/
- Current output: 0
- Expected: Unknown (no problem statement available)

testcase2.txt:
- Input: 11 characters in LED format  
- Precedence: /+-*
- Current output: Not tested
- Expected: Unknown

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
=======================

To complete this problem, you would need to:

1. Fix LED Pattern Parsing:
   - Verify LED patterns match input format
   - Handle spacing/alignment correctly
   - Debug why patterns don't match

2. Implement Expression Evaluator:
   - Build expression parser (shunting yard algorithm recommended)
   - Implement custom precedence handling  
   - Handle brackets correctly
   - Evaluate the parsed expression

3. Implement Variation Generation:
   - For each character position in equation
   - Try toggling exactly 1 LED segment
   - Check if result matches another valid character
   - Validate and evaluate resulting equation

4. Sum All Valid Equations:
   - Collect all valid equation values
   - Return sum

RECOMMENDATION:
===============

Without the full problem statement, it's difficult to:
- Know the expected output format
- Understand exact LED pattern encoding
- Verify correctness of approach

The code needs substantial completion (estimated 60-70% more work).

If you have the problem statement or expected outputs, that would help significantly in completing this solution.
